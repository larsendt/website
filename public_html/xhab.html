    <h1>About X-Hab</h1>

    <p>
    <a href="http://www.spacegrant.org/xhab">X-Hab</a> is a <a
        href="http://www.spacegrant.org/">National Space Grant Foundation</a>
    project. The goal of the project is to develop technologies for human habitats
    in space and other extreme environments. Multiple universities compete for
    small grants to prototype systems that solve the challenges of a long-term
    human presence in space.
    </p>

    <h1>Our Project</h1>

    <p>
    I am a part of the second X-Hab team that CU Boulder has put together. For
    both years of the competition, CU has focused on the technologies needed to
    grow plants with minimal to zero human access. The lofty goal of the project
    is to be a partially automated greenhouse sent to Mars ahead of human
    explorers and colonists for the purpose of growing edible plants.
    <p>

    <p>There are three primary components to the system:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>ROGR - the Remotely Operated Gardening Robot</li>
        <li>SPOT - Smart POT</li>
        <li>GUI - the (optionally) remote graphical user interface</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    <span class="big">ROGR</span> is a mobile platform that can travel around
    an environment to service distributed plant pots. It carries both pure
    water and a nutrient solution for refilling hydroponic pots. It also has
    both a lift and a robotic arm for moving and servicing the plants. It is
    intended to be remotely controlled via the GUI.  </p>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/qVEEsExWFzU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>
            In the above video, you can see the operation of ROGR's driving
            system. ROGR uses mechanum wheels that enable full planar motion.
            Mechanum wheels have rollers on the tread of the wheel that are
            angled at 45 degrees. The four equations (one for each wheel) are
            surprisingly elegant.

            $$frontleft = V_d sin(\Theta_d + \frac{\pi}{4}) + V_\Theta$$
            $$frontright = V_d cos(\Theta_d + \frac{\pi}{4}) - V_\Theta$$
            $$backleft = V_d cos(\Theta_d + \frac{\pi}{4}) + V_\Theta$$
            $$backright = V_d sin(\Theta_d + \frac{\pi}{4}) - V_\Theta$$

            Where $V_d$ is translation velocity, $\Theta_d$ is translation angle
            and $V_\Theta$ is rotation speed.

        <p>
            In this video, you can see ROGR's forklift. Not much to say about it,
            other than it works pretty well.

    <p>
    <span class="big">SPOT</span> is an intelligent hydroponic plant pot. It is
    capable of sustaining plant life independently for up to a week (depending
    on the variety of the plant and the stage in the plants life cycle). It
    contains both pure water and nutrient solution reservoirs. The nutrient
    solution is used in the automated hydroponic system, and the pure water is
    for maintaining a high humidity environment for the plant. To facilitate
    the high humidity environment, the SPOT has a clear plastic enclosure with
    vents for venting oxygen and bringing in carbon dioxide.  </p>

    <p>
    SPOT provides all necessary light for the plant. White LEDs with very
    specific spectra provide most of the growth light. Red LEDs are used to
    stimulate fruit growth when the plant reaches the fruiting stage of its
    life cycle. SPOT also contains a sophisticated sensor suite for monitoring
    the quality of the nutrient solution and the suitability of the
    environment.
    </p>

    <p>
    SPOT communicates wirelessly with a central computational hub located
    on ROGR. SPOT has onboard life cycle management and error detection,
    but offloading the data to ROGR allows for much more advanced analysis
    of the various data that SPOT gathers about its systems and its environment.
    SPOT is intended to be largely autonomous, but also allows for control via
    the GUI.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <span class="big">GUI</span> provides a remote interface for both data
    visualization and analysis, as well as control of the entire system. It
    displays multiple video streams from ROGR, and static images from SPOT's
    camera. It allows the user to view both realtime and historical data from
    both ROGR and any number of connected SPOTs. It has a realtime interface
    for driving ROGR and operating its lift and arm.  </p>
