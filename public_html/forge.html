    <h1>Building a Forge</h1>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>Motivated by 
    <a href="http://hackaday.com/2013/07/28/propane-forge-built-from-a-soup-can/">this Hackaday post</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>The Forge Casing</h2>
    <p>
        6 inch diameter steel pipe instead of a soup can, cut to a length of 1 foot.
        1 1/4 inch burner inlet [Figure 1] (eventual inner diameter of 1 inch). 
        Legs welded so that the burner is mounted horizontally [Figure 2].

    <h2>The Burner</h2>
    <p>
        Cast iron pipe - don't use galvanized pipe! From z-burner design:
        <a href="http://www.zoellerforge.com/zburner.html">
            http://www.zoellerforge.com/zburner.html
        </a>
        Originally used a 1/32nd" (???) welding tip for gas outlet, proved to be too
        small for good gas flow [Figure 6]. Ended up drilling a 1/16th" hole
        in a brass cap, which ended up working <i>much</i> better [Figure 10].

    <h2>Forge Insulation</h2>
    <p>
    The original Hackaday post that inspired this project used a mixture of 
    sand and plaster. While it appears that this works fine as an insulation
    medium, I expect that the longevity would be pretty poor. Instead, we
    went the route of high-temperature cement. The first thing we tried was
    <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/Hercules-1-2-gal-Furnace-Stove-Cement-35515/202078154">
    a high temperature furnace cement from Home Depot</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
    When we cracked the buckets open, we realized that rather than being a 
    viscous liquid, it was more the consistency of smoothly ground peanut
    butter. I went about jamming it in the form anyway, but about 3/4ths of the
    way though, the base of our form started to collapse. We decided to bail
    and pull all the cement out rather than try to recover. This turned out
    to be an excellent idea, because we would have been stuck with whatever
    final form the cement ended up in. Turns out, it dries rather like a 
    strong epoxy, which makes it nearly impossible to work with after it's
    dried.

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
    Unfortunately, we didn't get any good pictures of the first "pour" 
    (it was more like jamming peanut butter in with a spatula), because we
    both were covered in the cement. Figure 11 shows the form that eventually
    collapsed on us. We took a long sheet of aluminum (fairly thick), and 
    rolled it up to the right diameter so that we had two layers. We figured
    the double layer would be strong enough, which technically it was. 
    What we didn't anticipate was the aluminum curling up even further as the
    pressure from the cement grew, causing the diameter of our form to shrink.
    When we realized the form was collapsing we made a snap judgement,
    pulled the form out and scraped all the cement back into the buckets.

    </div>
    <p>
    We switched to a more standard dry-mix cement that is rated for high 
    temperatures. Also not pictured is our upgraded form (I forgot to grab a
    photo, sorry). We used a 3 inch OD plastic pipe wrapped first in 1/4 inch
    of foam padding and then saran wrap for easy removal. The total outer diameter
    was almost exactly 3.5 inches, exactly what we were aiming for. As Figure 12 shows,
    it worked great! We did file down those rough edges a bit and ground off the 
    cement that had slopped over the edge.

    The big moment! About to turn it on! You can see our final planned setup
    (that may yet change). The gas pipe is angled back, which we chose to do 
    because the end that it's angled toward will be covered with a fire brick
    when the forge is running at full steam.

    It lit! Nice big "whomp" of flame when it started up.

    <p>
    As you can see in Figure 17, that's not a terribly satisfying forge flame.
    We should have a roaring burning blue flame that's mostly contained to the 
    insulated chamber, not slow yellow-ish flames coming up and out. Do we have
    insufficient gas pressure? Do we have insufficient airflow? It's hard to
    see in the video, but close examination showed that about 90% of the
    combustion was occuring outside the main chamber. It was definitely looking
    like airflow problems.

    </div>

    <p>
    Given that we were likely seeing poor airflow, we decided to fire up the
    air compressor. You can see the very satisfying results in Figure 19. 
    The sound in the video really overstates how much air we were giving the 
    burner. We barely had to feed it any air to get a nice deep roaring flame.
    I could have probably produced similar results by lightly blowing into the
    air inlet.
